No additional notes provided.

## Review Contract

- `/design-systems/create` only collected setup inputs. All GitHub extraction, website/source URL review, local evidence intake, source reading, design-system construction, package audit, and artifact writes should happen inside this project workspace.
- DESIGN.md is the canonical source of truth.
- Use the canonical design-system title above for headings, README/SKILL names, preview labels, and UI-kit copy unless inspected evidence proves a more accurate product name. Never title the system from URL protocol text such as `https`.
- colors_and_type.css should hold concrete reusable tokens when the source evidence supports them; if fonts/ contains preserved font files, colors_and_type.css must bind those files with @font-face, @import, or url(...) references so typography does not fall back to substitute fonts.
- README.md and SKILL.md should make the extracted system reusable as a real Open Design design-system package.
- README.md should include a source-backed Product Overview/Product Context section, source repository or source folder references, package contents, a concrete `## Preview Manifest` listing every generated `preview/*.html` card, and reuse workflow, similar to Claude Design exports.
- SKILL.md should include YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `user-invocable`, plus Claude-style reusable skill sections: What is inside, Source context, When to use this skill, How to use, and Design system highlights. The usage guidance should point agents at README.md, DESIGN.md, colors_and_type.css, preview/, assets/, build/, fonts/, source_examples/, and ui_kits/app/.
- README.md, SKILL.md, DESIGN.md, and ui_kits/app/README.md must describe the final focused preview cards and `ui_kits/app/` paths, not old scaffold names such as `preview/typography-scale.html` or `ui_kits/generated_interface/`.
- preview/ should contain small reviewable HTML cards for typography, color themes, spacing, radius, shadows, brand assets, and component evidence.
- source_examples/ or equivalent root/nested source files should preserve selected high-signal original components when snapshots include substantial app/component source, similar to Claude Design exports that keep files like SelectModelButton.tsx or ChatNavBar/index.tsx alongside the package. These examples should contain substantive original implementation code, not tiny stubs that only share the component name.
- ui_kits/app/ should contain an applied interface example, plus substantive role-based files under `ui_kits/app/components/` when the source snapshots include representative app shells, navigation, chat/input surfaces, or reusable components. `ui_kits/app/README.md` should explain structure, component files, usage, design notes, and source basis. `ui_kits/app/index.html` must load `../../colors_and_type.css`, must load/import/compose the modular component files, and must mount/render the composed interface instead of staying as a standalone generic static mock or disconnected script list. If the entry directly loads `.jsx`/`.tsx` files, include React, ReactDOM, and Babel standalone scripts and expose each loaded component as `window.ComponentName` / `globalThis.ComponentName`, or write compiled browser-ready JavaScript instead. For chat/workspace evidence, cover app shell, sidebar/navigation, assistant/list rail, chat area, input bar/composer, and message bubble/comment roles; the app shell component must compose those roles into one product-like surface. Placeholder component shells are not sufficient.
Claude-style UI-kit entry contract:
- When `ui_kits/app/components/*.jsx` or `*.tsx` files exist, `ui_kits/app/index.html` must behave like a runnable browser entry, not a static mock.
- Use the same structure as Claude Design exports: load React, ReactDOM, and Babel standalone scripts, load `../../colors_and_type.css`, create a `#root`, load each component script from `components/`, then render the composed `App` component.
- `App.jsx` must assign `window.App = App` (or `globalThis.App = App`), and every directly loaded component file must expose the same browser global for its component name.
- Use this skeleton for direct JSX component kits, replacing the component list only when evidence supports different names:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.3.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.3.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone@7.29.0/babel.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../colors_and_type.css">
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/Sidebar.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/AssistantsList.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/ChatArea.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/MessageBubble.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/InputBar.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="components/App.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/babel">
const { App } = window;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
</script>
```
- Preview cards and UI-kit visuals should explicitly label or model source-backed modules from the captured evidence instead of generic placeholder modules.
- assets/, build/, fonts/, and context/ should preserve logos, app icons, tray icons, installer/runtime icons, wordmarks, font files, provenance, and source notes for future projects.
Claude-style build asset contract:
- When evidence includes `context/.../files/build/...`, create a root `build/` directory and copy representative runtime assets there with their original filenames and path intent, such as `build/icon.png`, `build/logo.png`, `build/tray_icon.png`, and `build/icon.ico`.
- Copy those runtime assets byte-for-byte from the captured `context/.../files/...` snapshots. Do not redraw, re-encode, optimize, or substitute generated placeholders for files that the evidence already captured.
- Do not satisfy build/runtime icon evidence by only renaming those files into `assets/`. `assets/` may include convenience aliases, but root `build/` must preserve the source runtime files for future agents and package consumers.
- `preview/brand-assets.html` should reference at least some real preserved files from `build/` or `assets/` with `<img>`, `<picture>`, `<object>`, or CSS `url(...)`, and README.md / SKILL.md should mention `build/` in the package manifest when it exists.
- preview/brand-assets.html should visibly reference preserved files from assets/ or build/ instead of recreating logos/icons as inline placeholder drawings.
- GitHub evidence must come from the bounded `github-design-context` command, not direct connector tree/content/raw tool calls. The command tries this-device git first, authenticated GitHub CLI second, and connector-platform fallback only when local access cannot read the repository.
- Linked local folder evidence should come from the bounded `local-design-context` command, which writes a local evidence note and snapshots under `context/local-code/` before final design-system rules are drafted.
- Before marking the design system ready, run `"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" tools connectors design-system-package-audit --path . --fail-on-warnings` and fix every reported error or warning.
- Draft design systems cannot be used by other projects until published.

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
      liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
      or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or support.
