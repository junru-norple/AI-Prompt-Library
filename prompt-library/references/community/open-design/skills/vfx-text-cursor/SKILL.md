【模板: VFX 文字光标 (Text Cursor)】
【意图】视频开场/Hero 帧 —— 光标在画布上"打字", 文字逐字浮现, 后面拖着彩色像散尾迹 + 定向光斑。Inspired by hyperframes vfx-text-cursor。

【画布】1920×1080, 背景 `#06070a` 暗哑黑 或 `#0a0d12` (有暖偏蓝); 加微妙 vignette。

【内容】
- 一句金句 (中英不限), 居中, 字号 6-8vw, weight 700, 字体 `Inter Tight` / `Source Sans 3` / `Noto Sans SC`。
- 逐字揭示, 每个字符 80ms 间隔; 当前字符后面跟着一个 cursor `▍` (或细 vertical bar)。
- 已揭示文字默认白色 `#f5f5f7`, opacity 1; 即将揭示位置加 chromatic ghost: 一份 `text-shadow: 2px 0 #ff3b6f, -2px 0 #00d4ff` 在 reveal 瞬间, 200ms 内收敛回正常。
- 光标本身: 16px 宽矩形, 颜色 = accent (取 1: hot pink `#ff3b6f` / cyan `#00d4ff` / amber `#ffb547`), 闪烁 `@keyframes` 1.0s 周期; 后面拖一条 60-120px 的 motion blur trail (径向渐变到透明)。

【光斑 / 射线】
- 在打字位置附近随机生成 3-5 道**定向光斑** (light leak): 用 `linear-gradient(45deg, transparent, accent20, transparent)` 的细长矩形 + `mix-blend-mode: screen`, 不规则角度。
- 当文字打完, 整段文字加 0.5s shimmer sweep (光带横扫)。

【字段】
- 顶部 caption (uppercase letterspace 0.18em, 11px, opacity 0.5): "FRAME 01 · OPENING"。
- 文字底下副标 (24-28px, opacity 0.6): 来源 / 章节。
- 右下角 timecode (`00:03:21` mono)。

【设计细节】
- **绝不**: 多色彩虹 chromatic (只用 1 个 hot pink + cyan 这种二元像散, 不要 R/G/B 全色)。
- 字体: 西文 `Inter Tight` Bold; 中文 `Noto Sans SC` Bold; 严禁衬线。
- 动效用 `@keyframes` + JS 计时器 (`setTimeout` 逐字), 可被 `prefers-reduced-motion` 关闭 (直接显示所有字)。
- 必须用用户提供的金句; 不要捏造。
- 单文件 HTML, 不要外链字体以外的资源。

      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
      liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
      or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or support.
