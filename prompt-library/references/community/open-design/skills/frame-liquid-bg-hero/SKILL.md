【模板: 流体背景 Hero】
【意图】可作为视频片头帧、SaaS landing 顶部 hero、海报底图。WebGL 流体感, 但用 CSS / canvas 退化绘制, 确保单文件可双击打开。Inspired by hyperframes vfx-liquid-background。

【画布】1920×1080 (横) 或 1080×1920 (竖), 二选一。背景占满。

【流体背景 — 3 种实现, 按用户偏好选】
1. **CSS 多层 radial-gradient 错位呼吸** (最稳, 默认推荐):
   - 3-5 个大椭圆 `radial-gradient(...)`, 颜色取自调色板。
   - 每个椭圆套 `@keyframes` 平移 + scale + hue-rotate, 周期 8-14s, 错峰; 整个画面叠 `mix-blend-mode: screen` 或 `overlay`。
   - 顶层加 1 层 `backdrop-filter: blur(80px)` 让边缘更糊。
2. **Canvas + simple perlin noise** (中阶):
   - 80 行 inline JS, 用 `requestAnimationFrame` 画 metaballs 或 simplex noise field。
   - 性能允许时启用, `prefers-reduced-motion` 时降回静态截图。
3. **WebGL fragment shader** (高阶, 慎用):
   - 用 jsdelivr CDN 引 `regl` 或 inline plain WebGL。
   - shader 写 domain-warp noise; 单个 quad, 一个 uniform `u_time`。

【顶层文字层】
- 居中或左下: 一句巨型金句 (5-7vw, 衬线或粗 sans), 字体: `Source Serif Pro` / `Inter Tight` / `Manrope Black`。
- 文字色用 paper white `#fafaf8` 或 ink, 取决于背景明暗; 加 `mix-blend-mode: difference` 让它在任何流体颜色上都可读。
- 副标 (小 sans, opacity 0.7) 一行。
- 底部可选 CTA chip 或 hairline + 元数据 row。

【调色 — 4 选 1, 不要彩虹】
- 🌅 **Solar Peach** — `#ffb18a` + `#f78b4c` + `#d97757`, 暖橙桃。
- 🌊 **Ocean Aqua** — `#5ac8fa` + `#0a84ff` + `#1e3a8a`, 海蓝。
- 🌌 **Aurora Violet** — `#a78bfa` + `#7c5cff` + `#1e1b4b`, 极光紫。
- 🌿 **Forest Mint** — `#86efac` + `#34d399` + `#065f46`, 苔森林。

【设计细节】
- 严禁: 多色彩虹 (>4 个色相)、PowerPoint 渐变、霓虹荧光叠加。
- 字体: 中文用 `Noto Serif SC` (display) / `Noto Sans SC` (副标)。
- 严禁外链图片; 全部 CSS + SVG + 可选 canvas。
- 必须用用户提供的金句 / 标题; 如果用户输入是数据 → 提炼一句 ≤ 18 字的金句。
- 单文件 HTML, 可被 `prefers-reduced-motion` 关动效。

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
      liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
      or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or support.
