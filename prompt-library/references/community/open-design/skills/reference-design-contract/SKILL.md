# Reference Design Contract

Use this skill when the user has taste signals, references, or a rough "like
this" request and needs a reusable design contract before generation. The goal
is not to write a longer prompt. The goal is to make design decisions explicit
enough that a later prototype, deck, redesign, or image-remix run can execute
without guessing.

## What this skill produces

Create three files:

1. `DESIGN.md` — the reusable visual direction, following Open Design's
   standard nine-section design-system shape.
2. `design-contract.md` — the decision record: evidence used, keep/change
   boundaries, rationale, risks, and quality gate.
3. `implementation-handoff.md` — concise build instructions for the next
   artifact-producing skill or coding agent.

If a preview is useful, also create `example.html` as a small hand-built
contract preview. Do not make it the main deliverable.

## Workflow

1. **Lock the job.** Identify target artifact type, audience, brand/product
   context, references, and constraints. Ask at most two questions only when a
   missing answer would change the direction. Otherwise choose a sensible
   default and label it as inferred.
2. **Read evidence.** Use provided screenshots, URLs, existing `DESIGN.md`,
   brand docs, image artifacts, or user notes. If evidence is missing, say so
   and base the contract on the brief only; do not invent brand facts.
3. **Separate reference semantics.** For every reference, split it into:
   - `Keep`: qualities to preserve, such as density, composition, material,
     typography rhythm, color temperature, or motion attitude.
   - `Change`: subject matter, copy, brand marks, exact layout, protected
     assets, and anything the user wants adapted.
   - `Do not copy`: literal screenshots, logos, claims, pricing, proprietary
     UI, or exact prompt wording from examples.
4. **Freeze the direction.** Choose one coherent visual stance. Do not provide
   five unrelated moodboards. If there are genuinely competing directions,
   name them briefly, pick the recommended one, and continue.
5. **Write `DESIGN.md`.** Use these nine headings exactly:
   - `## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere`
   - `## 2. Color`
   - `## 3. Typography`
   - `## 4. Spacing & Grid`
   - `## 5. Layout & Composition`
   - `## 6. Components`
   - `## 7. Motion & Interaction`
   - `## 8. Voice & Brand`
   - `## 9. Anti-patterns`
6. **Write `design-contract.md`.** Include:
   - goal and target artifact
   - evidence table with confidence (`observed`, `provided`, `inferred`)
   - keep/change/do-not-copy table
   - final design stance in one paragraph
   - risks and explicit unknowns
   - quality gate checklist
7. **Write `implementation-handoff.md`.** Keep it short and operational:
   - files to read
   - token/palette/type/layout constraints
   - asset rules
   - responsive requirements
   - "first artifact should prove..." acceptance notes
8. **Validate.** Read `references/checklist.md` and satisfy every P0 gate
   before final handoff.

## Output rules

- Make every claim traceable to user input, observed reference evidence, or an
  explicitly labeled inference.
- Prefer concrete constraints over adjectives: "one warm accent, no purple or
  blue glow" beats "premium".
- Treat "do the same style" as "borrow controllable qualities", not "clone the
  original subject or prompt".
- If the user asks for immediate UI generation too, finish these contract files
  first, then hand off to the appropriate artifact skill in the next step.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
      liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
      or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or support.
