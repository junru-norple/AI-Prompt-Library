【模板: 1920 画布自由 Deck】
【意图】不想被模板束缚的场景 (个人作品集、奇特演讲、艺术 / 设计课 deck)。给一个固定 1920×1080 画布 + 极强的类型 / 调色约束, 让 agent 像写 React 组件一样按内容自由排布每一页。Inspired by 1weiho/open-slide。

【硬性技术规格】
- 画布: 每页严格 `width: 1920px; height: 1080px;` 用 `transform: scale(...)` 适配视窗 (默认 `scale(0.7)` 居中)。
- **绝对禁止 overflow**: 每页内容必须 fit in 1920×1080, 不许滚动条出现。
- 字号 type scale (px): `2xs:18 · xs:22 · sm:28 · md:36 · lg:48 · xl:64 · 2xl:88 · 3xl:120 · 4xl:160 · 5xl:220`。
- 边距 padding: 96 / 128 / 160 三档之一。
- 每页有 `<section class="slide" data-slide-id="<n>">`。

【调色板 — 每个 deck 选 1 套, 全程不改】
- 🌫 **Ash & Lime** — bg `#f1efea`, ink `#161616`, accent `#c5e803`。
- 🌌 **Sea Indigo** — bg `#0a0e1a`, ink `#f5f5f7`, accent `#5ac8fa`。
- 🧉 **Mate Mocha** — bg `#1a1411`, ink `#f5e9d6`, accent `#d97757`。
- 🌸 **Pearl Rose** — bg `#fdf6f3`, ink `#1a1015`, accent `#ff5d8f`。

【布局自由度 — 这是核心】
- 不强制模板, 每页根据**内容性质**自选布局: cover / question / quote / image-text / 三列 / 五列 / 列表 / 数据卡 / 满版图。
- 但每页**必须遵守一条规则**: 视觉重心 (visual hierarchy) 只有 1 个 — 一句金句、一个数字、一张图, 不要"什么都强调"。
- 不许塞两段平等的文字; 真要并列就上 3 列等权重网格。

【字体】
- 西文: `Inter Tight` (display) + `Inter` (body); 或 `Source Serif Pro` (editorial 风时)。
- 中文: `Noto Sans SC` (sans 风) 或 `Noto Serif SC` (editorial 风); 不混 sans + serif。
- mono: `JetBrains Mono` 给数据 / 时间戳。

【设计细节】
- 严禁 emoji 装饰 (内容里的允许); 严禁多色彩虹; accent 只用一个色。
- 严禁 SVG icon 套用 lucide / feather 等通用库 (自己写 inline SVG)。
- 加键盘 ← / → 切换 + hash 同步; 角标固定: 右下 `№N/M`, 左下 deck title。
- 必须用用户的真实内容; 严禁 lorem ipsum。
- 单文件 HTML; Tailwind CDN; 不要外链图片。

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
      fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
      liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
      However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
      own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
      other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
      and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
      or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or support.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
